# 📁 Evidence Directory (Structure Only)

This folder represents the expected structure and organization of FedRAMP 20x evidence files by KSI (Key Security Indicator).

⚠️ **Note:** This public repository **does not include actual evidence artifacts**. Instead, it provides:

- Folder-level structure per KSI (`evidence/ksi-[code]/`)
- Optional `README_ksi-[code].md` files that describe the type of evidence expected
- Placeholder `.gitkeep` or metadata files where applicable

---

## 🔒 Why Artifacts Are Excluded

To protect sensitive implementation details, IP addresses, cloud configurations, and proprietary information, all raw evidence artifacts are securely stored in a **private repository**. This public repo retains only structural and reference metadata for transparency.

---

## 🧭 Relationship to Dashboard & Metadata

- The dashboard links to evidence references such as `evidence/ksi-cna/aws_shield_dos_protection.pdf`
- These references are mapped to:
  - Git commit hash
  - Timestamp
  - Evidence type (e.g. `static`, `cli_output`)
- This ensures traceability **without exposing the actual file contents**

---

## 🗂 Example KSI Folder Contents

```
evidence/
└── ksi-cna/
    ├── README_ksi-cna.md
    ├── nacl_inbound_rules.pdf
    ├── nacl_outbound_rules.pdf
    └── aws_shield_dos_protection.pdf
```

Each file is referenced from the submission package and used to back individual KSI assertions in the public trust dashboard.

    "notes": "This SBOM reflects anticipated components based on Elastic's official SDKs and guidance. Although the Elastic integration is not active at the time of submission, it is architecturally designed to support metadata-only indexing (e.g., course titles, tags) in future production deployments. The components listed are representative of the packages most commonly used for integrating Elastic Cloud into a Node.js-based LMS backend. This design-phase declaration supports KSI-3IR requirements for transparency and supply chain security.",

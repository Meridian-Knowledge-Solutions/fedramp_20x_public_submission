  "assertion": "The system manages supply chain risks by limiting third-party service use, ensuring FedRAMP authorization where applicable, and verifying vendor attestations, SBOMs, and architectural segmentation â€” even for inactive services scoped for future deployment.",
  "description": "The LMS architecture is hosted entirely in AWS Commercial, with one declared third-party: Elastic Cloud, used exclusively for metadata indexing (e.g., course titles, tags). This integration is not currently deployed but is fully documented in boundary diagrams and the SSP. No PII, PHI, audit records, or sensitive content is transmitted. If activated, outbound access would be scoped to Elastic Cloud endpoints using Security Groups, with monitoring via GuardDuty and CloudTrail. A forward-declared SBOM and vendor attestation are included. All other third-party components are FedRAMP-authorized or excluded from the Low boundary.",

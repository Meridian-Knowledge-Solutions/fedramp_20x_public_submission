  "assertion": "The system uses a cloud-native architecture to isolate components, enforce traffic control, and minimize attack surface through zero trust design.",
  "description": "The system is built on immutable, Terraform-managed infrastructure using AWS-native services to enforce strict segmentation, minimize exposure, and maintain configuration integrity. Components are isolated through scoped IAM roles, dedicated VPCs, and NACLs. Public-facing access is tightly controlled via AWS WAF and security groups. Compute resources operate without persistent state or credentials, using session-based administrative access through AWS SSM. This architecture reduces lateral movement risk and configuration drift while aligning with zero trust principles.",

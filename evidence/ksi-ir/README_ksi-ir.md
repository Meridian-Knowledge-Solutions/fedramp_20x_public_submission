# KSI-IR: Incident Response

## 🎯 Intent (from FedRAMP 20x)
A secure cloud service offering will maintain, test, and execute effective Incident Response Plans for routine incidents such as vulnerability discovery, abnormal activity detection, and exfiltration of data.

## ✅ Assertion
The system maintains, tests, and executes incident response and recovery processes aligned with federal requirements for detection, reporting, and recovery.

## 📘 Description
Meridian has implemented a formal incident response and contingency management program documented in the Contingency Plan. The plan outlines roles, responsibilities, escalation paths, and defines both Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). Annual tabletop exercises and disaster recovery tests are conducted to evaluate readiness, as documented in test reports and post-mortems. Quick reference guides ensure all operational staff have clear IR procedures during active scenarios. All IR activities are reviewed during quarterly security audits and integrated into the system security lifecycle.

## 🔐 Mapped FedRAMP Controls

## 🧪 Validation Method
IR planning and readiness are validated by:
- Reviewing the documented contingency plan and test plan
- Verifying completed test reports and associated findings
- Ensuring quick-reference procedures are distributed and accessible
- Logging quarterly audits and lessons learned reviews

# FedRAMP Low 20x Pilot: Meridian LMS

This repository contains Meridian Knowledge Solutions' official submission to the **FedRAMP 20x Phase One Pilot**, representing a modern, machine-readable authorization package for a Low-impact SaaS environment. It includes Key Security Indicator (KSI) validations, structured evidence, and automated compliance artifacts in alignment with emerging 20x guidance and the FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609).

## 🌐 Live Trust Dashboard (Public)
A live, interactive dashboard showcasing all KSI validations is available here:

This dashboard is:
- Automatically updated on every commit
- Linked directly to the KSI validation JSON
- Designed for transparency, audit readiness, and continuous trust reporting
